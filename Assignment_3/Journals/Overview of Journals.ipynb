    "<h3>A Novel Approach for Pharmacological Substantiation of Safety Signals Using Plasma Concentrations of Medication and Administrative/Healthcare Databases: A Case Study Using Danish Registries for an FDA Warning on Lamotrigine</h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    This study introduces the <strong>PHARMACOM-EPI framework</strong>, which integrates pharmacometrics into pharmacoepidemiological research. The framework was applied to investigate the risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death associated with lamotrigine, an anti-seizure medication. The study uses Danish administrative and healthcare data, focusing on older individuals diagnosed with epilepsy who were exposed to lamotrigine. By predicting plasma concentrations and categorizing them into toxic and non-toxic ranges, the study explores the connection between toxic plasma concentrations and an increased risk of mortality. This framework helps substantiate safety signals, such as the FDA warning on lamotrigine, using real-world data.\n",

    "<h3>A Newly Developed Method for Assessing Co-Exposure to Free Dose Combinations: A Proof-of-Concept Study Using Antihypertensive Medications in Danish Registers</h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    This paper presents a method for assessing co-exposure to multiple antihypertensive medications, utilizing Danish health registers. The focus is on older adults who began antihypertensive therapy, with the goal of identifying common combinations of antihypertensive medications over time. The method also helps in analyzing trends in medication use and adherence, providing insights into medication management for chronic conditions like hypertension.\n",

    "<h3>Exploring the Challenges in Studying Medication Adherence</h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    This article addresses the challenges related to medication adherence, particularly for chronic conditions like hypertension. It provides a detailed discussion of how non-adherence can significantly impact health outcomes and explores various techniques for measuring adherence. The paper emphasizes the need for more accurate and effective methods to monitor and improve patient compliance with prescribed medications, highlighting common barriers that patients face when following their medication regimens.\n",
