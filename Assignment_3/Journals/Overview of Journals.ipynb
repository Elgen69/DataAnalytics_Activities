    "<h3>A Novel Approach for Pharmacological Substantiation of Safety Signals Using Plasma Concentrations of Medication and Administrative/Healthcare Databases: A Case Study Using Danish Registries for an FDA Warning on Lamotrigine</h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    This study introduces the <strong>PHARMACOM-EPI framework</strong>, which integrates pharmacometrics into pharmacoepidemiological research. The framework was applied to investigate the risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death associated with lamotrigine, an anti-seizure medication. By combining real-world data from Danish administrative and healthcare registers, the study analyzed plasma concentrations and their correlation to adverse health outcomes, especially focusing on older adults with epilepsy. The researchers used predictive modeling to categorize plasma concentrations into toxic and non-toxic ranges, assessing how these concentrations relate to increased mortality risks. This study underlines the importance of using real-world data to substantiate safety signals, like the FDA warning on lamotrigine, offering a significant contribution to the pharmacovigilance field.\n",

    "<h3>A Newly Developed Method for Assessing Co-Exposure to Free Dose Combinations: A Proof-of-Concept Study Using Antihypertensive Medications in Danish Registers</h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    In this paper, a novel method was developed for assessing co-exposure to multiple antihypertensive medications using data from Danish health registers. The study focused on older adults starting antihypertensive therapy and aimed to identify common combinations of medications over time. The authors utilized clustering techniques to analyze overlapping medication events, which provided insights into medication adherence patterns and trends in the usage of free-dose combinations. This method not only helps track medication use but also informs adherence strategies for managing complex chronic conditions like hypertension. The findings contribute to understanding polypharmacy in the elderly, offering guidance for clinicians in prescribing and monitoring long-term treatments.\n",

    "<h3>Exploring the Challenges in Studying Medication Adherence</h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    This article delves into the numerous challenges faced in studying medication adherence, particularly for chronic conditions like hypertension. It addresses how non-adherence can have profound effects on health outcomes, including complications from untreated hypertension. The paper evaluates various adherence measurement techniques, including self-reports, pill counts, and electronic monitoring, and discusses the limitations of these methods. The study emphasizes the need for more accurate tools and strategies to improve patient compliance with prescribed regimens, suggesting interventions like personalized counseling, reminder systems, and better healthcare monitoring. This article underscores the necessity for continuous improvement in methods to measure and promote adherence, addressing patient barriers like forgetfulness, side effects, and financial costs.\n",
