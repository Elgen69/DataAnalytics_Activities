🔍 Overview
This repository contains implementations of various assignments from our Data Analytics course. Each assignment focuses on different analytical techniques, data processing methods, and visualization strategies. The goal is to apply theoretical concepts to real-world datasets and develop proficiency in Python for data analysis.

📌 Assignments
Each assignment is structured as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) or Python script (.py), with clear documentation and visualization of results.

📁 Assignment 1: Balanced Risk Set Matching
Objective: Implement the Balanced Risk Set Matching Algorithm for an observational study analyzing the effects of Cystoscopy and Hydrodistention on Interstitial Cystitis patients.
Key Steps:
Load patient data from a CSV file.
Compute Mahalanobis distances to match treated and control patients.
Solve an Integer Programming (IP) problem to optimize matching.
Perform sensitivity analysis to check robustness.
Tech Stack: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn

📁 Assignment 2: [TBD]
Objective: [TBD]
Key Steps:
[Step 1]
[Step 2]
[Step 3]

Tech Stack: [Relevant Python libraries used]
📁 Assignment 3: [Title of the Assignment]
